        Created for EEL4709 Computer Design course in Florida 
        International University.

        The main objective of the project was to create an always online 
        voice assistant on a Raspberry Pi Model 4, like Google Home or 
        Amazon Alexa, capable of answering questions and responding to 
        user voice input. The focus was on providing the user with a 
        voice-activated interface to interact with the Bing Chat bot 
        that is accessible with the Microsoft Edge browser effectively.
